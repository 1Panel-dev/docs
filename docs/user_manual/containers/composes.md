# Composes

Docker Compose simplifies the process of managing multi-container applications. The Composes view lists all compose projects, as well as applications from the App Store.

## Create a compose project

There are three methods to deploy a new compose project from 1Panel:

- Edit: Define services using the Web editor.
- Path selection: Choose an existing docker-compose.yml from a specified path on the server.
- Compose template: Select an existing Compose template.

## Edit a compose project

Existing compose projects can be edited to modify their configurations.

Compose projects can be categorized into three types based on their origin:

- Apps Store: Created from app store application deployments;
- 1Panel: Created from the 1Panel console;
- Local: Created directly on the server via command line.

## Container list of the compose project

By clicking the name of the compose project, you can enter the compose project details page, which displays the container list corresponding to the compose project.
