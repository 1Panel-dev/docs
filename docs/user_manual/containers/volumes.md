# Volumes

A Volume is a data storage area that can be mounted in a container to provide persistent storage.The Volumes view in 1Panel lets you create, delete, and perform other actions on your volumes.

## Create a volume

By clicking the `Create` button, you can create a Docker volume through the creation form.

## Browse files in a volume

By clicking the `Volume directory` in the volume list, you can directly access the corresponding directory and use 1Panel's file management feature to browse and manage files within the volume.

## Remove volumes

You can directly delete specific volumes from the volume list, or click the `Prune` button to clean up all unused local volumes.
